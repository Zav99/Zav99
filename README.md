Hi There!
This is just a short introduction to me. I'm currently in the early stages of learning IT but am making progress everyday. Here's a few things about me:


ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently working on a web app to generate unabriged books of no less than 100 pages per book generation. This project uses Google's Vertex AI API as the backbone of all it's content. More information will be provided soon ... 

ðŸ§¬ Iâ€™m currently learning Oracle SQL for University and on my on time I learn Machine Learning.
